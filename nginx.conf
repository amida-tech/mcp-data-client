# The official nginx docker image, which the docker image that runs this nginx.conf is based off of, has
# CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
# My Dockerfile has CMD ["/etc/nginx/docker-entrypoint.sh"] because I need to run this custom command.
# From within that custom command, calling `nginx -g "daemon off;"` isn't working, so I just put the `daemon off;` directive here.
